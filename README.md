# NFT-OnChain-Random
In this Project, and thanks to Patrick Collins, I was able to generate a random OnChain NFT using HardHat
Description : 

1) Step one : 
Our first Step is to install all the requirements we need to run this project ( See below for more ) 
2) Step Two :
Next, We will create our first smart contract called SVGNFT which will be able to read SVG code and transform it to an NFT
3) Step Three : 
Next we will write our deploy file which will help us to deploy and test our smart contract
4) Step Four :
We will do almost the same steps, but this time we will create more functions to our new smart contract that will help us randomize the SVG code in a readable way 
5) Step Five : 
We will also need to create a new deploy file for our new smart contract
6) Step Six :
We will deploy our smart contract to rinkeby and you can also see the results directly in OpenSea :
