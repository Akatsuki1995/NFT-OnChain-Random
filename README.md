# NFT-OnChain-Random  

This project demonstrates the generation of random on-chain NFTs using Hardhat, inspired by Patrick Collins. The project guides you through the steps of creating smart contracts, deploying them, and showcasing the results on OpenSea.  

## Project Overview  

### Key Features  
1. **On-Chain SVG Rendering**:  
   - A smart contract (`SVGNFT`) reads SVG code and transforms it into an NFT directly on-chain.  
2. **Randomized SVG Generation**:  
   - Enhances the SVG rendering process by adding functions to randomize SVG elements for unique NFT outputs.  
3. **Deployment and Testing**:  
   - Comprehensive deployment scripts for deploying and testing the smart contracts.  
4. **Integration with OpenSea**:  
   - Deployed on the Rinkeby testnet, enabling visualization and interaction via OpenSea.  

### Step-by-Step Implementation  

1. **Setup**:  
   - Install all necessary dependencies to run the project. Detailed requirements are listed below.  

2. **Smart Contract Development**:  
   - Create an initial smart contract (`SVGNFT`) capable of reading and transforming SVG code into an NFT.  

3. **Deployment Script for SVGNFT**:  
   - Develop and execute the deployment script to test the contract functionality.  

4. **Enhanced Smart Contract with Randomization**:  
   - Expand the functionality of the smart contract to include SVG randomization, generating unique on-chain NFTs.  

5. **Deploy Enhanced Smart Contract**:  
   - Write and execute a new deployment script for the updated smart contract.  

6. **Deploy to Rinkeby Testnet**:  
   - Deploy the finalized contract to the Rinkeby testnet. Results can be viewed on OpenSea:
